 -> class: 

  - In Python everything is an object
  - start class name with 'CAPITAL letter'
  - A class is a user-defined blueprint/prototype from which objects are created
  - provide a means of bundling data and functionality together
  - creating new class, creates a 'new object', allowing new instance of that type to be made
  - Class creates a user-defined data structure

  -> Important points:
   - created by keyword 'class'
   - attributes have varibles that belongs to a class
   - attributes are always public, can be accessed using 'dot(.)'


 -> object:
    - instance of a class
    - class -> blue print
      instnace -> copy of the class with its actual values.

    - An object consists of :
      - State: represented by the attributes of an object
               reflects the properties of an object

      - Behaviour: represented by methods of the object
                   reflects response of an object to other object

      - Identity: object's unique name
                  enables one object to interact with another


 -> self:
    - similar to this 'pointer' in C++ and 'this reference' in Java



 -> __init__ method:

    - similar to 'constructors' in C++ and Java
    - Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state
    - Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions)  # noqa: E501
      that are executed at the time of Object creation.
    - runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated
    - useful to do any initialization with object
    - or usefult to instialize all the objects we're going to use with the class

    - min. it takes 1 parmeter (i.e self)

s = "Hello!"   # 's' is an insatnce of object/class str (i.e. string)
s.upper()
